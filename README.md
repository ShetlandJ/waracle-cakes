## Coding test for Waracle ##

This code was written as a coding test for [Waracle](https://waracle.net) by [John Pollard](https://bravelocation.com)

## Some notes ##

Just a few quick notes on how I wrote the code:

- I've been looking for an excuse to learn a little about ReactJS, so this seemed the perfect opportunity 
to try it out. Note I basically learnt ReactJS from scratch as I went along, so apologies if 
I missed using any common patterns or packages that would have been a better way of solving the problem.
- I added minimal design by adding a little bit of Bootstrap, but as requested spent little time on doing this
- I normally would have added tests around the code, but time-contraints stopped me doing this.


## Running the code ##

The easiest was of running the code is via npm, following the usual procedure of:

1. `npm install` to fetch the required node packages
2. `npm start` to start the react webserver
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser


### Footnote ###

I've done a few coding tests over the years, and I really enjoyed doing this one. It struck a good balance
between being enough of a challenge to get stuck into, without being overly burdensome. Thanks to whoever set it!
